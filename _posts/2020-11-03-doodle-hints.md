# Doodle Hints Spring 2020 --> 4-12 David/Jay’s OH Questions
- Screen not rotating → Part 1... why??
  - enable **'Auto-Rotate'** if it isn't yet.
- Why is my dog picture so small?
  - Be sure to check the spec for the example screenshot, and set your constraints correctly. See Android documentation for further details
  - Check the documentation especially for constraint types
- Addressed Part 2 View → some people set their parent constraint layout to id -1, should be 0!!
  - this might give an error, so please watch out for this
