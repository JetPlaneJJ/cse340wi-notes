We will be using Gitlab and Android Studio as our development environment. You will need to have your computer prepared for Lab on Thursday - you’re welcome to get a head start on this now so you can work along with us in class: 

Android Basics:
- Download Android Studio (Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 is the latest version) and [install it](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
- Select the Tools->SDK Manager and make sure you have API level 29 installed. This is the version of the Android SDK we will use for this class. 
- To test your setup, follow this tutorial to create an Android Application.
- Continue with the tutorial to also run your app either on an emulator or on an Android Device. To be compatible with our testing framework for our assignments, you should run the Pixel 2 Emulator.

IMPORTANT: We understand that not everyone has access to an Android Phone or a machine with enough processing power and memory to support the emulator, so our wonderful Allen School support team has made a limited number of Android Phones available for daily loans. To borrow a phone you must visit the Allen School Help Desk (in Allen/CSE 207) during regular business hours. In the event that you need a phone during times of remote instruction, you may email (support@cs) or call (206.685.1224) and ask them to leave a phone at the front desk for pick up. Should you need a phone for a longer period of time due to personal circumstances, we will ask you to send a private email message to the instructor to ensure a phone can be shipped to you as soon as possible.Requests will likely be filled on a first come first served basis 

Git Setup: macOS, Windows (ignore pieces about VSCode as we use Android Studio - we will have updated resources shortly)

Make sure you have git setup on your computer, follow above instructions

If you have never used git before read through this and this (Android Studio ≈ Intellij)

Ensure that you can clone from CSE GitLab (we recommend cloning via SSH but you’ll need to generate a key)
