  <li>Your PPS should always return true if the <strong>next touch events should still continue to be delivered to this View</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>Return true = ‚ÄúThis View is still interested in events of this gesture (ex: until ACTION_UP)‚Äù.</li>
      <li>Thus, only return false when you want the touch event to be passed up to the parent View.</li>
      <li>Events will be bubbled up the view hierarchy until some View consumes it.</li>
