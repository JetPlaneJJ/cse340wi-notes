<ul>
  <li>Your color picker can be the custom one, just needs to correctly select colors.</li>
  <li>The color picker can be placed anywhere as long as the whole thing is inside the screen</li>
  <li>All visible buttons should be grayed out/not usable immediately after clicking color_fab (leave color fab enabled)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-4-ideas">Part 4 ideas</h2>
<p><strong>Note: please use the existing undo and redo classes. The Action should be reversible.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearing the whole screen</li>
  <li>Dashed/dotted lines when drawing</li>
  <li>Emojis drawn along path</li>
  <li>Fill entire canvas with color</li>
</ul>

<p>Reflection:
Be sure to group your data based on “like” issues, not based on who sent them to you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>include specific steps you would take to solve the issues you found with the default Undo app.</li>
  <li>can suggest new heuristics for the “how well do the heuristics fit”?
Others Hints
From Lecture Winter 2020:
```java
// RrvDrawActivity: Contains ALL buttons
// Rvdrawingact: Implements a class that allows you to undo the redo, allows u to commit actions, calls
// AbstractDrActvity: No history, adding menus</li>
</ul>

<p>// DrawingView: Keeps track of stroke views
	// has onTouchEvent with Pps state machine</p>

<p>// Possible to implement action: Emojis, dotted lines… THERE IS A WORKSHEET, SEE WEBSITE FOR PDF DOWNLOAD!!!
```
From Lecture Spring 2020 (5/22):
Review: all systems have at least 3 models (Design/what you thought the system should do, System Image: your implementation, User Model/How the user thinks the system works)</p>
